CAN is a vehicle communication protocol, which is developed by Bosch. The idea behind that framework is to realize a master-slave communication through a bus, and with adressing certain Nodes give commands or get network diagnostics. Each frame contains an arbitration field, a DLC field(Data length counter), and the data field which has to be declared if we would like to communicate.
