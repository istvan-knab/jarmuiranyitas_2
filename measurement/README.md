# Measuring

## Idea behind the practice

In lack of existing model, we will try for first model-free control, to describe the yaw-movement of our car. 
The idea is to determine for each speed-steering angle combination the belonging yaw-angle, and through it will
be find the correlation between steering-angle and torque distribution .
